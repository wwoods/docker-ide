# To copy/paste, use Ctrl+b [ to enable copy mode, use the arrow keys to move
# around, space to begin a selection, and finally "y" to yank the selected
# text.  It will then be both in the system clipboard and tmux's buffer, which
# may be re-pasted via Ctrl+b ].

##### Configure plugins #####
# NOTE: This REQUIRES the following command to be run:
#
# $ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
#
# After that, do C-b I in tmux to install the other plugins.

# Plugins to use
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'

# Initialize the plugin manager
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
